# Introduction

**Maera** is a developer-friendly theme that allows you to quickly prototype sites and extend it with your own custom plugins.

**It's a kick-ass open-minded theming framework.**

It is completely open-source, licensed under the MIT license
In its heart it uses the [twig templating engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) and the WordPress Customizer.

With Maera we're introducing the concept of theme **shells**.  An easy way to completely customize the theme with your own markup, css, scripts and functionality to meet your own needs!
